## Game History

You are a bounty hunter, who earns his living by searching for valuable items in the legendary MAZE ADVENTURES and selling them at PAWNSHOP, located just outside the maze. However, you are very fond of your DORA THE EXPLORER backpack and you never carry more weight than it takes, otherwise you risk ruining it.
Your challenge then is to always choose the best combinations of items trying to earn as much money as possible but without carrying too much weight and end up ripping your beautiful backpack.
